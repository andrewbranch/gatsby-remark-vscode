## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Open an issue

PRs introducing new ideas are always welcome, but might be declined if opened without any prior discussion. To avoid wasted work, it’s always best to [open an issue](https://github.com/andrewbranch/gatsby-remark-vscode/issues/new) first.

## Local development setup

Prerequisites: development is supported on the current [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install`

Running `npm install` should automatically initialize or update the [vscode](./vscode) submodule, generate `src/graphql/schema.d.ts`, and populate [`lib/grammars`](lib/grammars) and [`lib/themes`](lib/themes). If any of these things are missing, you’ll get errors when you try to run things later. You can rerun these steps with `npm run build`.

## Tests

To run tests, run `npm test`. You can use Jest CLI options after a `--` separator. For example, to run just the test named “code-fence-meta”, use `npm test -- -t code-fence-meta`.

Most tests are either Jest snapshot tests or HTML baseline tests against a known-good source ([`test/integration/cases/baselines`](test/integration/cases/baselines)). To update the snapshots and baselines, run `npm test -- -u`.

Most new tests can be integration tests. To write one, create a new folder in `test/integration/cases`, then put a Markdown file named `test.md` inside. If you want to run the plugin with custom options, place an `options.js` file whose `module.exports` is the options object to be passed to the plugin. Then, when you next run `npm test`, the baseline will be created and opened in a browser so you can view the resulting HTML. If it looks right, commit it and you’re done. If it looks wrong, you can overwrite the bad baseline by running `npm test -- -u -t name-of-test` after you’ve made changes to fix your code.

## Debugging

VS Code launch scripts have been provided, so you can debug the tests or the [example site](examples/example-site) by using VS Code’s debug menu. Otherwise, you can always run `node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand` and attach with whatever debugger you like.

## Get ready for a PR

When you’ve made changes you’re happy with, ensure that you have

- Added a test if appropriate,
- Formatted your changes through Prettier with `npm run format`,
- Maintained good JSDoc type annotations to the best of your ability.

This project is written in plain JavaScript, but uses TypeScript to type-check via JSDoc annotations. After tests, type checking runs (and can be run alone with `npm run check`). If types are new to you, or you have trouble getting type checking to pass, that’s ok! I’ll help you in your PR if necessary. Type checking is a great way to catch errors early, but I don’t want it to be an impediment for anyone’s contribution.
